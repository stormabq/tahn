As of this date I am not sure how this repo and
[rust-search](https://github.com/stormasm/rust-search)
are exactly related but suffice it to say until this
statement is either removed or clarified that they
are basically identical repos.

To index a set of documents

```
indexhn filename
```

[an example filename called story-title.json is here](https://github.com/stormasm/hackernews-story-archive/tree/master/data)

To then search the documents

```
searchpb string
```

[searchpb is here](https://github.com/stormasm/rust-search/tree/master/tantivy/tan01/examples)
